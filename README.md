### Users Benefits and Goals

#### A) For the first-time user

The website provides entertainment for both solo and duo players. Furthermore, novices can leverage the platform to grasp the foundational rules of basketball. A blend of text and visual elements enhances user engagement and evokes positive emotions.

#### For returning and frequent users

The game's appeal may lie in its quick completion time, catering perfectly to instances when players are pressed for time.

### Design

The game's **landing page** captivates their interest with an inspiring image, a title, and a brief but motivational description outlining the game's objective: scoring 21 points.

The game boasts multiple **interactive elements**.
Notably, there are two main buttons: *'host'* and *'guest.'* These buttons allow players to earn 0, 1, 2, or 3 points with every click. The accumulated points are displayed in real-time on the **result board.** Additionally, based on the points scored, relevant **photos** are showcased beneath the gaming console. For example, scoring 3 points reveals an image of a player taking a shot from the 3-point line.
The **conclusion of the game** is marked by a relevant message announcing the winer.
The **Reset Game** button is used to initiate a fresh start of the game.

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
