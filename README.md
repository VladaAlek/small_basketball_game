### Users Benefits and Goals

#### A) For the first-time user

The website provides entertainment for both solo and duo players. Furthermore, novices can leverage the platform to grasp the foundational rules of basketball. A blend of text and visual elements enhances user engagement and evokes positive emotions.

#### For returning and frequent users

The game's appeal may lie in its quick completion time, catering perfectly to instances when players are pressed for time.

### Design

The game's **landing page** captivates their interest with an inspiring image, a title, and a brief but motivational description outlining the game's objective: scoring 21 points.

The game boasts multiple **interactive elements**.
Notably, there are two main buttons: *'host'* and *'guest.'* These buttons allow players to earn 0, 1, 2, or 3 points with every click. The accumulated points are displayed in real-time on the **result board.** Additionally, based on the points scored, relevant **photos** are showcased beneath the gaming console. For example, scoring 3 points reveals an image of a player taking a shot from the 3-point line.
The **conclusion of the game** is marked by a relevant message announcing the winer.
The **Reset Game** button is used to initiate a fresh start of the game.
