## User Experience (UX) Section

## Objective

The goal of this simple online game is to entertain users, especially those passionate about basketball. The game's objective: scoring 21 points.

## Users Benefits and Goals

#### A) For the first-time user

The game's objective is to score 21 points.
The website provides entertainment for both solo and duo players. Furthermore, novices can leverage the platform to grasp the foundational rules of basketball. A blend of text and visual elements enhances user engagement and evokes positive emotions.

#### For returning and frequent users

The game's appeal may lie in its quick completion time, catering perfectly to instances when players are pressed for time.

### Design

The **favicon** appears in the browser's address bar when visiting the site.

**Instruction Page**

Upon loading the page, the user is presented with the game's straightforward rules. They are displayed on a black overlay above the main site page. The game begins when the user clicks the **start button**.
The project consists of the **main** and **error** page
The **main page** captivates the user's interest with an inspiring image and a title in *the landing* section.

**Main Page**

The game boasts multiple **interactive elements**.
Notably, there are two main buttons: *'Host'* and *'Guest.'* These buttons allow players to earn 0, 1, 2, or 3 points with every click. The accumulated points are displayed in real-time on the **result board.** Additionally, based on the points scored, relevant **photos** are showcased beneath the gaming console. For example, scoring 3 points reveals an image of a player taking a shot from the 3-point line.
The appearance of photos is followed by an appropriate **soundtrack**.
The **conclusion of the game** is marked by a relevant photo announcing the winning team, host, or guest.
The **Reset Game** button is used to initiate a fresh start of the game.

**Error Page**

For website users, having a well-designed Error Page is essential. In keeping with design consistency, this page closely mirrors the aesthetic of the "Main Page". 
Users can conveniently navigate back to the Main Page using the **Homepage** button.

A significant departure from the initial design involves removing the "Guest Wins!" section, present in the Figure no. 3 and repositioning the "Host," "Guest," and "Reset Button" elements.
Menthor suggested the creation of the Instruction layer and introduction of a obvious responce, in this case audio, when clicking Host/Guest buttons

## Testing User Stories from the UX Section

#### First-Time Visitor Goals

- As a first-time visitor, clarity and quick understanding are paramount. Right off the bat, the site welcomes users with clear and short instructions, making it easy to understand what to expect during further usage of the web product.
- Directly below, a clearly visible *start button* makes it easy for a smooth transition to the game level.

- At this level, seamless site usage is essential too. The website is designed with two-play buttons (*Host* and *Guest*), ensuring users can effortlessly enjoy the game.
- The same principle applies to the *Reset button*, which enables a new session to commence.
- by using CSS technology, all buttons stated above, as well as the “Homepage” button in the 404.html page interact with the user when hovered over.

#### Returning and Frequent Visitor Goals

For these two categories, the website offers a captivating experience which tempts them to use this product multiple times.

#### Observations on Smartphone Device Adaptability

- We identified a design constraint on smartphones when the device orientation is switched to landscape mode. In the initial design, it wasn't possible to see the “Score Board”, “Game Container”, and the associated images all at once.
- In our *updated design*, we've made modifications to the height of the “Game Container” and adjusted margins. This ensures a better view of all three sections. While this enhancement addresses the design and functionality challenges to some extent, it's a step forward, but not a complete resolution.

### Further Testing

-The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Firefox web browsers.
-The project was designed for the screen with the following width sizes: 320px 768px and 1024px.
-The website was viewed and responsiveness controlled on various devices of various screen sizes (smartphone, tablet, 1024px).
-Extensive testing was conducted to verify correct linking across all pages, including the 404.html page and Google Fonts URL.
